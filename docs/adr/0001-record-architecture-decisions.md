# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2026-02-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard to document significant architectural decisions.

## Consequences

- Architectural decisions will be transparent and tracked in version control.
- Future maintainers will understand the "why" behind domestic decisions.
